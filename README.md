### Twitter Bootstrap

- This is an optional subunit on Twitter Bootstrap. This material is very good to know, but not mandatory for course completion. You will find Bootstrap in some of the starter codes throughout the course, but you will not need to know how to write any Bootstrap code in order to complete any projects. When reading through this code, you might be confused about what the Bootstrap does - in that case, either Google the classes or refer to this subunit.

- Also note, that since the release of this course, a newer version of Bootstrap has been released. You must use Bootstrap 4, not 5, for this subunit and course. 

-  we'll cover Twitter Bootstrap. Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks and is essential for modern front-end web development. We'll go over what Bootstrap is, why you would use it, and some of the most useful features it offers.
